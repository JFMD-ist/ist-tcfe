Now that we have the values for the voltages in every node, we can use Ohm's Law to calculate the current flowing through $V_x$:
$V_6 - V_8 = R_5 \cdot I_x \iff I_x = \frac{V_6 - V_8}{R_5} = $ \input{Ix.tex}A,
and with the current $I_x$, the equivalent resistance becomes $R_{eq} = \frac{V_x}{I_x} =$ \input{Req.tex}$\Omega$.
